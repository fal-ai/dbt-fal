# Introduction

The fal ecosystem has two main components: The `fal` CLI and the `dbt-fal` adapter.

## `fal` â€“ ðŸ“– [README](./projects/fal)

With the `fal` CLI, you can:

- [Send Slack notifications](https://github.com/fal-ai/fal/tree/main/examples/slack-example) upon dbt model success or failure.
- [Load data from external data sources](https://blog.fal.ai/populate-dbt-models-with-csv-data/) before a model starts running.
- [Download dbt models](https://docs.fal.ai/fal/python-package) into a Python context with a familiar syntax: `ref('my_dbt_model')` using `FalDbt`
- [Programatically access rich metadata](https://docs.fal.ai/fal/reference/variables-and-functions) about your dbt project.

Check out the [`fal` README](./projects/fal) for more information.

For more details on `fal`, [go to the documentation](https://docs.fal.ai/)!

## `dbt-fal` â€“ ðŸ“– [README](./projects/adapter)

With the `dbt-fal` Python adapter, you can:

- Enable a developer-friendly Python environment for most databases, including ones without dbt Python support such as Redshift, Postgres.
- Use Python libraries such as [`sklearn`](https://scikit-learn.org/) or [`prophet`](https://facebook.github.io/prophet/) to build more complex `dbt` models including ML models.
- Easily manage your Python environments with [`isolate`](https://github.com/fal-ai/isolate).
- Iterate on your Python models locally and then [scale them out in the cloud](https://fal.ai#signup).

Check out the [`dbt-fal` README](./projects/adapter) for more information.

For more details on `dbt-fal`, [go to the documentation](https://docs.fal.ai/dbt-fal/quickstart)!

# Why are we building this?

We think `dbt` is great because it empowers data people to get more done with the tools that they are already familiar with.

`dbt`'s SQL only design is powerful, but if you ever want to get out of SQL-land and connect to external services or get into Python-land for any reason, you will have a hard time. We built `fal` to enable Python workloads (sending alerts to Slack, building predictive models, pushing data to non-data-warehouse destinations and more) **right within `dbt`**.

This library will form the basis of our attempt to more comprehensively enable **data science workloads** downstream of `dbt`. And because having reliable data pipelines is the most important ingredient in building predictive analytics, we are building a library that integrates well with dbt.
