# 🌅 Sunset Announcement

As of April 2024, **dbt-fal** has been officially sunsetted. This strategic pivot allows our team to focus on creating [the world's first generative media platform specifically designed for developers](https://fal.ai) — a venture we believe in passionately. This decision was made after careful consideration, and we want to extend our sincerest gratitude to all our users and contributors who have been part of this journey. While it's always tough to say goodbye, we're proud of what we've accomplished together.

## ❗ What Does This Mean?

- **No Further Development:** The project will no longer receive updates or new features.
- **Security Vulnerabilities:** We will not be addressing new security vulnerabilities after April 8 2024. We advise users to consider this when deciding to continue the use of the project.
- **Archival:** The repository will be archived, making it read-only. While the code will remain accessible for educational and historical purposes, we encourage users to fork the repository if they wish to continue development on their own.

## 💬 FAQ

### Can I still use dbt-fal?
Yes, the project will remain available for use, but please be aware that no new updates or security patches will be provided moving forward.

### What are some alternatives to dbt-fal?
Unfortunately, none that we are aware of.

### I have more questions. Who can I talk to?
Please feel free to contact us on our [discord](https://fal.ai/).

## 🙌 Special Thanks
We want to take a moment to thank everyone who contributed to dbt-fal, from our amazing contributors and users to anyone who spread the word about our project. Your support was invaluable.

# Introduction - 📖 [README](./projects/adapter)

The dbt-fal ecosystem has two main components: The command line and the adapter.

## CLI

With the CLI, you can:

- [Send Slack notifications](https://github.com/fal-ai/fal/tree/main/examples/slack-example) upon dbt model success or failure.
- [Load data from external data sources](https://blog.fal.ai/populate-dbt-models-with-csv-data/) before a model starts running.
- [Download dbt models](https://docs.fal.ai/fal/python-package) into a Python context with a familiar syntax: `ref('my_dbt_model')` using `FalDbt`
- [Programatically access rich metadata](https://docs.fal.ai/fal/reference/variables-and-functions) about your dbt project.

## Python Adapter

With the Python adapter, you can:

- Enable a developer-friendly Python environment for most databases, including ones without dbt Python support such as Redshift, Postgres.
- Use Python libraries such as [`sklearn`](https://scikit-learn.org/) or [`prophet`](https://facebook.github.io/prophet/) to build more complex `dbt` models including ML models.
- Easily manage your Python environments with [`isolate`](https://github.com/fal-ai/isolate).
- Iterate on your Python models locally and then [scale them out in the cloud](https://fal.ai#signup).

# Why are we building this?

We think `dbt` is great because it empowers data people to get more done with the tools that they are already familiar with.

This library will form the basis of our attempt to more comprehensively enable **data science workloads** downstream of `dbt`. And because having reliable data pipelines is the most important ingredient in building predictive analytics, we are building a library that integrates well with dbt.
