With fal, you can:

- Send Slack notifications upon dbt model success or failure.
- Download dbt models into a Python context with a familiar syntax: `ref('my_dbt_model')`
- Use Python libraries such as [`sklearn`](https://scikit-learn.org/) or [`prophet`](https://facebook.github.io/prophet/) to build more complex pipelines downstream of **[and in between (new!)](https://blog.fal.ai/python-or-sql-why-not-both/)** `dbt` models.

and more...

Check out our [Getting Started](#getting-started) guide to get a quickstart, head to our [documentation site](https://docs.fal.ai/) for a deeper dive or play with [in-depth examples](#examples) to see how fal can help you get more done with dbt.

# Getting Started

## 1. Install fal

```bash
$ pip install fal
```

## 2. Go to your dbt directory

```bash
$ cd ~/src/my_dbt_project
```

## 3. Create a Python script: `send_slack_message.py`

```python
import os
from slack_sdk import WebClient
from slack_sdk.errors import SlackApiError

CHANNEL_ID = os.getenv("SLACK_BOT_CHANNEL")
SLACK_TOKEN = os.getenv("SLACK_BOT_TOKEN")

client = WebClient(token=SLACK_TOKEN)
message_text = f"Model: {context.current_model.name}. Status: {context.current_model.status}."

try:
    response = client.chat_postMessage(
        channel=CHANNEL_ID,
        text=message_text
    )
except SlackApiError as e:
    assert e.response["error"]
```

## 4. Add a `meta` section in your `schema.yml`

```yaml
models:
  - name: historical_ozone_levels
    description: Ozone levels
    config:
      materialized: table
    columns:
      - name: ozone_level
        description: Ozone level
      - name: ds
        description: Date
    meta:
      fal:
        scripts:
          - send_slack_message.py
```

## 5. (New!) Run `fal flow run` 

```bash
$ fal flow run
# both your dbt models and fal scripts are run
```

## 6. Alternatively run `dbt` and `fal` consecutively

```bash
$ dbt run
# Your dbt models are run

$ fal run
# Your python scripts are run
```

# How it works?

`fal` is a command line tool that can read the state of your `dbt` project and help you run Python scripts after your `dbt run`s by leveraging the [`meta` config](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/resource-configs/meta).

```yaml
models:
  - name: historical_ozone_levels
    ...
    meta:
      fal:
        scripts:
          - send_slack_message.py
          - another_python_script.py # will be run after the first script
```

`fal` also provides useful helpers within the Python context to seamlessly interact with dbt models: `ref("my_dbt_model_name")` will pull a dbt model into your Python script as a [`pandas.DataFrame`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.html).

### Running scripts before dbt runs

The `--before` flag let's users run scripts before their dbt runs.

Given the following schema.yml:

```
models:
  - name: boston
    description: Ozone levels
    config:
      materialized: table
    meta:
      owner: "@meder"
      fal:
      	scripts:
          before:
            - fal_scripts/postgres.py
  	      after:
            - fal_scripts/slack.py
```

`fal run --before` will run `fal_scripts/postgres.py` script regardless if dbt has calculated the boston model or not. `fal run` without the `--before` flag, will run `fal_scripts/slack.py`, but only if boston model is already calculated by dbt.

A typical workflow involves running `dbt run` after invoking `fal run --before`.

```bash
$ fal run --before --select boston
$ dbt run --select boston
```

# Concepts

## profile.yml and Credentials

`fal` integrates with `dbt`'s `profile.yml` file to access and read data from the data warehouse. Once you setup credentials in your `profile.yml` file for your existing `dbt` workflows anytime you use `ref` or `source` to create a dataframe `fal` authenticates using the credentials specified in the `profile.yml` file.

## `meta` Syntax

```yaml
models:
  - name: historical_ozone_levels
    ...
    meta:
      owner: "@me"
      fal:
        scripts:
          - send_slack_message.py
          - another_python_script.py # will be run sequentially
```

Use the `fal` and `scripts` keys underneath the `meta` config to let `fal` CLI know where to look for the Python scripts. You can pass a list of scripts as shown above to run one or more scripts as a post-hook operation after a `dbt run`.

## Variables and functions

Inside a Python script, you get access to some useful variables and functions

### Variables

A `context` object with information relevant to the model through which the script was run. For the [`meta` Syntax](#meta-syntax) example, we would get the following:

```python
context.current_model.name
#= historical_ozone_levels

context.current_model.meta
#= {'owner': '@me'}

context.current_model.meta.get("owner")
#= '@me'

context.current_model.status
# Could be one of
#= 'success'
#= 'error'
#= 'skipped'
```

`context` object also has access to test information related to the current model. If the previous dbt command was either `test` or `build`, the `context.current_model.test` property is populated with a list of tests:

```python
context.current_model.tests
#= [CurrentTest(name='not_null', modelname='historical_ozone_levels, column='ds', status='Pass')]
```

### `ref` and `source` functions

There are also available some familiar functions from `dbt`

```python
# Refer to dbt models or sources by name and returns it as `pandas.DataFrame`
ref('model_name')
source('source_name', 'table_name')

# You can use it to get the running model data
ref(context.current_model.name)
```

### `write_to_source` function

It is also possible to send data back to your datawarehouse. This makes it easy to get the data, process it and upload it back into dbt territory.

All you have to do is define the target source in your schema and use it in fal.
This operation appends to the existing source by default and should only be used targetting tables, not views.

```python
# Upload a `pandas.DataFrame` back to the datawarehouse
write_to_source(df, 'source_name', 'table_name2')
```

`write_to_source` also accepts an optional `dtype` argument, which lets you specify datatypes of columns. It works the same way as `dtype` argument for [`DataFrame.to_sql` function](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.to_sql.html).

```python
from sqlalchemy.types import Integer
# Upload but specifically create the `value` column with type `integer`
# Can be useful if data has `None` values
write_to_source(df, 'source', 'table', dtype={'value': Integer()})
```

## Importing `fal` as a Python package

You may be interested in accessing dbt models and sources easily from a Jupyter Notebook or another Python script.
For that, just import the `fal` package and intantiate a FalDbt project:

```py
from fal import FalDbt
faldbt = FalDbt(profiles_dir="~/.dbt", project_dir="../my_project")

faldbt.list_sources()
# [['results', 'ticket_data_sentiment_analysis']]

faldbt.list_models()
# {
#   'zendesk_ticket_metrics': <RunStatus.Success: 'success'>,
#   'stg_o3values': <RunStatus.Success: 'success'>,
#   'stg_zendesk_ticket_data': <RunStatus.Success: 'success'>,
#   'stg_counties': <RunStatus.Success: 'success'>
# }

sentiments = faldbt.source('results', 'ticket_data_sentiment_analysis')
# pandas.DataFrame
tickets = faldbt.ref('stg_zendesk_ticket_data')
# pandas.DataFrame
```

# Supported `dbt` versions

Any extra configuration to work with different `dbt` versions is not needed, latest `fal` version currently supports:

- 0.20.\*
- 0.21.\*
- 1.0.\*

If you need another version, [open an issue](https://github.com/fal-ai/fal/issues/new) and we will take a look!

# Why are we building this?

We think `dbt` is great because it empowers data people to get more done with the tools that they are already familiar with.

`dbt`'s SQL only design is powerful, but if you ever want to get out of SQL-land and connect to external services or get into Python-land for any reason, you will have a hard time. We built `fal` to enable Python workloads (sending alerts to Slack, building predictive models, pushing data to non-data warehose destinations and more) **right within `dbt`**.

This library will form the basis of our attempt to more comprehensively enable **data science workloads** downstream of dbt. And because having reliable data pipelines is the most important ingredient in building predictive analytics, we are building a library that integrates well with dbt.
