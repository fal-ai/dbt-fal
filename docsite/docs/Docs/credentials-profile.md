# Credentials and dbt profiles

`fal` integrates with `dbt`'s `profile.yml` file to access and read data from the data warehouse. Once you setup credentials in your `profile.yml` file for your existing `dbt` workflows anytime you use `ref` or `source` to create a dataframe `fal` authenticates using the credentials specified in the `profile.yml` file.
