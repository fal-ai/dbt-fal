# Select `before` and `after` scripts

For node selection, `fal` handles [dbt's selection flags](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/node-selection/syntax):

```
-s SELECT [SELECT ...], --select SELECT [SELECT ...]
                      Specify the nodes to include.
-m SELECT [SELECT ...], --models SELECT [SELECT ...]
                      Specify the nodes to include.
--exclude EXCLUDE [EXCLUDE ...]
                      Specify the nodes to exclude.
--selector SELECTOR   The selector name to use, as defined in selectors.yml
```

You may pass more than one selection at a time and use graph operators:

```bash
$ fal flow run --select model_alpha+ model_beta+
Executing command: dbt --log-format json run --project-dir fal/fal_dbt_examples --profiles-dir . --exclude lombardia_covid miami
