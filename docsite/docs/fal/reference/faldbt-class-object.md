# The FalDbt class

The `FalDbt` is available from the `fal` package to import in a script. This is used to read the configurations of a dbt project. 

You must provide a `profiles_dir` and a `project_dir` for a dbt project.

Some of the methods available are:

- `<method>`: Explanation
  ```python
  faldbt.<method>()
  #= <example output>
  ```
...

TODO: This section needs to be completed once we settle on the API to expose. Also, consider private vs public properties.
