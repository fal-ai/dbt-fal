# `meta` Syntax

```yaml
models:
  - name: historical_ozone_levels
    ...
    meta:
      owner: "@me"
      fal:
        scripts:
          - send_slack_message.py
          - another_python_script.py # will be run sequentially
```

Use the `fal` and `scripts` keys underneath the `meta` config to let `fal` CLI know where to look for the Python scripts. You can pass a list of scripts as shown above to run one or more scripts as a post-hook operation after a `dbt run`.
